I have also attended several on many different technologies including Angular, TypeScript, Cloud Computing and many others related to the Company Software.Its one of the best things about kronos that we hold regular technical training sessions which help us to keep ourselves updated to the new Technologies even though we might not be using them in day today life.  </p>"
